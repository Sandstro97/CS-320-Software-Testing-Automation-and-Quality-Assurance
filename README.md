How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
I think the best way for me to make sure my software if functional and secure is to use the tools that are given to you. Using jUnit was something that I never used before but after using it I saw how effective it can be when used correctly. 

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Knowing what is being asked for is an important first step. I made sure to understand all of the requirements before I even start coding. One thing that I did was make a document that had all the requirements so then I could cross off the list as I went through making my code to make sure I had everything. 

How do I approach designing software?
I think you need to know what is needed before you can even start. Having a list to check off is something I use to keep track of all the requirements. From their I just start with the first one and work my way through the list. If I come into any roadblocks then I ask for help.
